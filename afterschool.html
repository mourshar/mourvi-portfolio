            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>An afterschool STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) program designed for children aged 6-8 years. This program brought engaging, hands-on science and math activities to students outside of regular school hours, using the beloved Galli Galli Sim Sim characters to make learning exciting and accessible.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Design Principles</h2>
            <p>The program was built on key principles for effective STEM education with young children:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Hands-On Learning:</strong> Children learned by doing, experimenting, and exploring rather than through passive instruction</li>
                <li><strong>Inquiry-Based:</strong> Encouraged children to ask questions, make predictions, and discover answers through investigation</li>
                <li><strong>Developmentally Appropriate:</strong> All activities were designed specifically for the 6-8 age range, matching their cognitive and physical capabilities</li>
                <li><strong>Engaging Characters:</strong> Integrated beloved Sesame Street characters to maintain interest and create familiar entry points into new concepts</li>
                <li><strong>Teacher Support:</strong> Provided comprehensive resources and training to ensure teachers felt confident delivering STEM content</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Program Impact</h2>
            <p>By establishing both the educational framework and the instructor team, this program successfully:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>Introduced STEM concepts to children who might not otherwise have access to such learning</li>
                <li>Built confidence in both students and teachers around science and math</li>
                <li>Created a replicable model for afterschool STEM programming</li>
                <li>Demonstrated that young children can engage meaningfully with complex concepts when properly scaffolded</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Critical Role</h2>
