            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Learn to Read, Read to Learn was Sesame Workshop India's first large-scale digital literacy initiative-designed to test how mobile technology, print materials, and teacher training could improve reading outcomes for children in low-resource rural settings. As Content & Education Manager, I led the educational strategy, learning design, and multi-modal content development for this ambitious program.</p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>I directed the end-to-end learning design, blending mobile games, culturally grounded print materials, and a robust teacher training program into a cohesive literacy curriculum. I oversaw the creation of 10 Hindi literacy games, companion workbooks, and classroom activities featuring Galli Galli Sim Sim (Sesame Street India) characters. I also designed and delivered teacher trainings that equipped educators to integrate digital learning tools effectively into their classrooms.</p>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>The program reached 42,000 children across 400+ schools, implemented in partnership with:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>Government of Bihar (Phase 1: 30,000 students)</li>
                <li>Government of Maharashtra (Phase 2: 12,000 students)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Independent evaluation showed:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>Children using mobile games performed better in 3 of 5 literacy indicators compared to print-only learners</li>
                <li>Significant gains in oral reading fluency and comprehension</li>
                <li>Clear evidence that mobile technology can meaningfully improve literacy in low-resource environments</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These results validated Sesame Workshop India's first digital literacy intervention and influenced subsequent learning innovation across multiple regions.</p>

            <h2>Why It Was Innovative</h2>
            <p>This program pioneered:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>Low-cost mobile games as a literacy tool in areas with limited infrastructure</li>
                <li>Pico projectors for local teacher training in schools without electricity</li>
                <li>A multi-modal literacy model combining screens, print, and in-classroom facilitation</li>
                <li>A culturally relevant approach that blended global educational expertise with local learning realities</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The project became an exemplar of how thoughtful EdTech design can overcome infrastructural barriers and deliver measurable impact at scale.</p>
