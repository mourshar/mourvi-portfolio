                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>At Meta, I worked on the AI Characters ecosystem, focusing on how to make conversational AI more structured, expressive, and scalable across Instagram and Facebook. My role sat at the intersection of conversation design, game design, creative content systems, and evaluative quality.</p>

                    <h2>Conversation Design and Content Strategy</h2>
                    <p>I led the conversational and interaction design for Scenes, a structured AI format that replaces open-ended chat with guided, purposeful experiences. I built the underlying frameworks for how AI characters speak to users-and to each other-in both single-agent and multi-agent contexts. These included dialogue flows, turn-taking patterns, role-play scaffolds, and system prompts that shaped tone, pacing, and intent. The result: AI interactions that feel smoother, more intentional, and more engaging.</p>

                    <h2>Game-Informed Conversational Experiences</h2>
                    <p>Drawing on my background in games, I introduced game-like structures into AI chat-to give users clear goals, progression, and agency. I helped pilot game-like interactions with AI characters inspired by mini RPGs and visual novel-style games.</p>

                    <p>These experiences helped transform conversational AI from passive back-and-forth into interactive play and narrative-driven engagement.</p>

                    <h2>Creative Content Systems & Scaling</h2>
                    <p>I designed the underlying content architectures and scalable prompting systems that powered Scenes and AI Character Profiles. Working closely with engineers, I created structured "content recipes" capable of generating hundreds of high-quality experiences-stories, Scenes, posts, and multimodal outputs-in a single run. This allowed us to scale creative output rapidly while maintaining character identity, narrative coherence, and quality.</p>

                    <h2>Evaluation & Quality Frameworks</h2>
                    <p>To support safe and reliable scaling, I built the evaluation pipelines used across multiple AI character products. I wrote quality guidelines, trained annotators, defined objective scoring rubrics, and partnered with data science and engineering teams to run evaluations at scale-thousands of content items per week. We used these evaluations to set release thresholds, refine prompting systems, and build golden sets that informed future model improvements.</p>

                    <h2>Creative Leadership</h2>
                    <p>Along the way, I led a team of writers, game designers, and AI artists-guiding ideation, prompt craft, and execution across generative storytelling, multimodal content, and conversational design.</p>
