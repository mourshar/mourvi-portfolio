                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Radiophone was a groundbreaking initiative that brought Sesame Street content to children in remote, low-resource regions of India through community radio and a radio-over-telephone system. As Content & Education Manager, I led the educational and creative adaptation of Sesame Street's visual format into an engaging audio-only experience designed for communities with little or no access to television.</p>

                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>I directed the educational content design, script development, and curriculum integration across literacy, health, and social–emotional development. Working with writers, producers, and local radio teams, I transformed Sesame Street's character-driven storytelling into a compelling audio format that used sound design, descriptive narration, and playful language to create immersive learning experiences.</p>

                    <h2>Why It Was Innovative</h2>
                    <p>Radiophone reimagined Sesame Street for India's most underserved communities by pairing:</p>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li>Community radio broadcasts, and</li>
                        <li>A toll-free "radio over phone" system, allowing families to call in and listen anywhere.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This was one of India's earliest large-scale uses of mobile phones to deliver educational media.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="project-section">
                    <h2>Impact</h2>
                    <p>The program reached 1.2 million people, including 200,000 children, across 10 community radio stations.</p>

                    <p>Independent evaluation showed:</p>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li>Significant gains in 5 out of 6 learning outcomes (literacy, language, health, social-emotional skills, environmental awareness)</li>
                        <li>2× improvement in key skills for children exposed to Radiophone content</li>
                        <li>Real-world behavioural change: improved hygiene, higher school attendance, parents seeking vaccinations, and community-led initiatives like waste-management drives and women's rights gatherings</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The show aired for 2.5 years, and additional community radio stations requested to adopt the model-evidence of its cultural resonance and sustained value.</p>
